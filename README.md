# cheers_take2
The ruby cheers exercise (see: elizabrock/cheers), this time 3 weeks into learning Ruby, with tests!


## Instructions
(What is the class supposed to do)

* `chmod +x filename` to make a file executable

## Specifications, for non-interactive version of cheers
(How does the program work)

### Help Usage

Run the program by running `./cheers`

The program will print out:

> I'd cheer for you, if only I knew who you were :(

> Try again with `./cheers [Name] [MM/DD Birthday]`

### Regular Usage

Run the program by running `./cheers.rb Abby 08/25`

The first argument is the user's name.  The second argument is the user's birthday.

The program outputs a cheer in the following format:

> Give me an... A

> Give me a... B

> Give me a... B

> Give me a... Y

> Abby’s just GRAND!

* Follow the proper grammatical for a and an. The rule is based on whether the spelling of a letter would begin with a vowel.
* Skip non-word characters when printing the cheer (e.g. "Give me a..." lines)
* Print the user's name out as it was originally input for the "just GRAND" line

After printing the cheer, the program outputs the number of days until the user's birthday:

> Awesome!  Your birthday is in 45 days! Happy Birthday in advance!

If there was no input for birthday, the program instead says:

> I would wish you a Happy Birthday, if I knew when that was!

If the input for birthday wasn't parseable, the program would instead say:

> I couldn't understand that. Could you give that to me in mm/dd format next time?


## Specifications, for interactive version of cheers
(How does the program work)

Start the program by running `./cheers.rb`

The program should ask:

> Hello! What is your name?

The user types in their name, for example:

> Abby

The program outputs a cheer in the following format:

> Give me an... A

> Give me a... B

> Give me a... B

> Give me a... Y

> Abby’s just GRAND!

* If there was no input, ask again until valid input is provided
* Follow the proper grammatical for a and an. The rule is based on whether the spelling of a letter would begin with a vowel.
* Skip non-word characters when printing the cheer (e.g. "Give me a..." lines)
* Print the user's name out as it was originally input for the "just GRAND" line

After printing out the user's cheer, the program asks:

> Hey, Abby, what's your birthday? (mm/dd)

The user types in their birthdate

> 08/25

* If there was no input, asks again until valid input is provided
* If there was input that couldn't be parsed, the program tries again, but with the prompt:

> I couldn't understand that. Could you give that to me in mm/dd format?

The program then outputs the number of days until the user's birthday

> Awesome!  Your birthday is in 45 days! Happy Birthday in advance!
